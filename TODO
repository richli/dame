High priority
-------------

* Split mode: Can the zoomer window show both?
* Implement crossfade mode
* Make a single view and comparison view mode more explicit

Low priority
------------

* Window icon: make a high heel or something ladylike
* Create and show the difference SIR in comparison view?
* Finish context menu in MainViewer (for opening, closing, splitting, etc)?
* Be able to open gzipped SIR files (use libarchive? Or the Python stuff?)
* Add keyboard shortcuts for changing display range, popup zoomer window, etc
* Add panner window?
* Status bar: I'm still not satisfied with it...
* Use basemap to draw coastlines and such? Show lat/lon gridlines?
* Make a man page?
* Support reading sir.nc files (NetCDF formatted SIR files) and sir.h5 (HDF5 formatted SIR files)?
* In ``setup.py``, include a way to download and compile libsir.so?

Known bugs
----------

* If zoomer window is focused, key presses don't go through to main window
