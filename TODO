TODO

High priority
-------------

* Redesign UI: make a single view and comparison view mode more explicit
* Implement crossfade mode

Low priority
------------

* Ensure it runs on Python 2.7 and 3.3 (unified codebase)
* Window icon: make a high heel or something ladylike
* Create and show the difference SIR in comparison view?
* Finish context menu in MainViewer (for opening, closing, splitting, etc)?
* Be able to open gzipped SIR files (use libarchive? Or the Python stuff?)
* Add keyboard shortcuts for changing display range, popup zoomer window, etc
* Add panner window?
* Status bar: I'm still not satisfied with it...
* Use basemap to draw coastlines and such? Show lat/lon gridlines?
* Be able to draw a region box? For example, given lower-left and upper-right corners, draw the region bounding box. Note that due to map projections, the box probably won't be square. This shouldn't be too hard once basemap is used.
* Make a man page?
* Support reading sir.nc files (NetCDF formatted SIR files) and sir.h5 (HDF5 formatted SIR files)?
* In ``setup.py``, include a way to download and compile libsir.so?

Known bugs
----------

* If zoomer window is focused, key presses don't go through to main window
