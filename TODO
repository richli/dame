* v0.1
* Create Arch PKGBUILD
* Add keyboard shortcuts to move crosshair (like in sirtool; simp doesn't have it)
* Be able to change display range
* Be able to add some notes to each SIR (use QDockWidget)
* v0.2
* Support reading sir.nc files (NetCDF formatted SIR files)
* v0.3
* Add a mode to compare two SIRs together

  * Crossfade between them
  * Side-by-side: moving one moves both
  * Clicking a pixel displays the value in both SIRs
  * Create and show the difference SIR

* Window icon: make a high heel or something ladylike
* Add tabs for multiple files
* Be able to open gzipped SIR files
* Maybe have a Python implementation of libsir as a fallback?
