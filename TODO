* Basic simp functionality

  * Zoomer window
  * Show SIR header info (use C SIR library)

* Add keyboard shortcuts to move crosshair (like in sirtool; simp doesn't have it)
* Create Arch PKGBUILD
* As a template for package layout, use picard
* Add tabs for multiple files?
* Be able to open gzipped SIR files
* Be able to add some notes to each SIR
* Add a mode to compare two SIRs together

  * Crossfade between them
  * Side-by-side: moving one moves both
  * Clicking a pixel displays the value in both SIRs
